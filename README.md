# exploitdb-cve-search-jupyter
## What is this? 
This is a demo of my script to search CVEs for known exploits from ExploitDB. The script uses selenium, a browser automation library, to scrape the data from CVE search queries. If you want to run this yourself (on your own machine), you will need a local installation of Jupyter Notebook (and Python3) to open this .ipynb file and Google Chrome. See the .ipynb file in this repository (which you can view on GitHub directly) for more details.
